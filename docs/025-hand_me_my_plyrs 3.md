# Introduction

The `tidyverse` is a package that loads a whole bunch of other packages. These allow you to write R in a certain way, called 'tidy'. This is kind of like speaking a dialect of a spoken language. It's still the same language, but it's also different.

The key package within the `tidyverse` is called `dplyr`, which is pronounced 'dee-plier', hence the horrible pun in the title. We're going to cover a lot of different functions here, and it may be a bit overwhelming, but just try to apply them to something that you're interested in, be that [stochastic convergence rates](https://github.com/awstringer1/aghq), [baseball](https://www.hodgettsp.com/blog/baseball-a-defensive-critique/), or [DMC embroidery floss colour](https://sharlagelfand.github.io/dmc/).
