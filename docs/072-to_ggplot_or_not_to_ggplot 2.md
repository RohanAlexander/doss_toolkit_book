# (PART\*) To ggplot or not to ggplot {-}


# Introduction

I hope that this module will make you love plotting your data. When you're using data, there's almost nothing more important than just showing the data that you're interested in. The `ggplot2` package has become the go-to for graphing in R.

It's a powerful and versatile tool and I think that you're going to love learning about it.
