In this lesson, you will learn how to:

- Plot box-plot and line-plot using the `ggplot` package


Prerequisite skills include:

- Having `ggplot` installed and loaded
- Basic familiarity with `ggplot`

Highlights:

- Customize your plots box-plots and line-plots.


## The content

### box-plot
A box-plot is a visual representation of the distribution of numerical data. It allows you to easily see where your data is concentrated and the variation of the data based on the minimum, the maximum, the sample median, and the first and third quartiles. Additionally, it can be used to compare the variation between different groups.


Here we have a builted in dataset called `chickwts`. This dataset contains 71 observations and 2 variable: weight and feed. The variable weight is a numeric variable giving the chick weigh, and variable feed is a factor giving the feed type. 

```{r simple}
chickwts
```


To create a box-plot, we simply input a factor variable as x and a numerical variable as y when we specify the aesthetic mappings in `ggplot()`. Then we tell R to generate a box-plot by adding a `gemo_boxplot()` layer.  

```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
#### Arguments

##### Change box plot colors

We can change the box-plot line colors by adding a color parameter in `ggplot()`
```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight, color = feed)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Or we can also change the fill color by specifying fill parameter in `ggplot()`
```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight, fill = feed)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Using colors adds more contrast between different groups.




##### Change outlier color, shape and size
In `geom_boxplot()`, we can change the color, shape and size for the outliers to make it more stand out.
```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=8,
                outlier.size=4)
```
To change the shape of the outlier to a square, we can specify `outlier.shape = 0`
```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour="red", outlier.shape=0,
                outlier.size=4)
```

##### Legends Locations

If you want to hide the legend, you may do so by specify `show.legend = F` 
```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight, fill = feed)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = F)
```

Or if you want to change the legend position, you may add a theme layer and specify `theme(legend.position="bottom")` or `theme(legend.position="top")`. 

```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight, fill = feed)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + theme(legend.position="bottom")
```
```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight, fill = feed)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + theme(legend.position="top")
```




```{r}
chickwts %>% ggplot(aes(x = feed, y = weight, fill = feed)) + 
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = F)
```


### Line plot
A line plot is very similar to a scatter plot except that the measurement points are ordered(usually by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. It is often used to show a trend in the your data over a time interval. 

The input data frame requires 2 columns:

- An ordered numeric variable for the X axis
- Another numeric variable for the Y axis

Here is a basic line plot:

```{r}
set.seed(10)
# Generate x and y
x <- 1:10
y <- x + rnorm(10, 10, 5)
data <- data.frame(x,y)

# Plot
data %>% ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_line()
```

We can also plot multiple lines on the plot to compare the trends between different variable.

In `ggplot2` package, there is a dataset called economics_long. It contains a date variable, a variable describing the economic statistics such as total population and unemployment count, and its value. 

```{r}
economics_long
```


```{r}
ggplot(economics_long, aes(date, value01, color = variable)) +
  geom_line()
```
Notice that we added `color = variable` to differentiate between different economic statistic. 


##### Arguments

`geom_line()` has several optional arguments to customize the line plot.

`color`: A string specify the Color of the line
`size`: a number specify the  Size of the line 
`alpha`: a number from (0,1] specify the transparency of the line, lower value means more transparent
`linetype`: line type can be specified using either text (“blank”, “solid”, “dashed”, “dotted”, “dotdash”, “longdash”, “twodash”) or number (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Note that `linetype = “solid”` is identical to `linetype=1`.

```{r}
data %>% ggplot(aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_line(color="blue", size=1.5, alpha=0.5, linetype="dotted")
```

## Exercises

    a. `geom_point()`
    b. `geom_histogram()`
    c. `geom_bar()`
    d.   `geom_boxplot()`

## Common Mistakes & Errors
- When connecting `ggplot()` to `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_line()` make sure you use a plus sign (+) instead of the pipe operator. 
- For box-plot, make sure you have at least one numerical variable on the y-axis
- For line plot, make sure you have an ordered numeric variable for the x-axis and another numeric variable for the y-axis
